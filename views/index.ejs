          <p>In our society today, there has been a significant surge in interest in health and well-being. 
          The act of walking has firmly established itself as an essential habit for those who prioritize their health, and there is a growing number of individuals who find joy in walking, irrespective of its direct health benefits. Particularly, 
          people who wear smartwatches have shown a keen interest in monitoring and measuring their heart rates.
          </p>  
          <p>Nowadays, we no longer consider walking as just a simple activity; rather, it has become an integral part of our overall health management. Through the use of smartwatches, we can monitor our heart rates in real-time and track our activity levels while walking, enabling us to take control of our health proactively.
          
          This trend is proving to be highly beneficial for those who place a premium on their health, offering all of us an opportunity to lead healthier lives.</p>
          
          Following this trend, PersonalMap utilizes heart rate information and heart rate elevation data in conjunction with its navigation features to predict estimated walking times accurately.
          
          With PersonalMap, let's not only find our way on foot but also take charge of our health.
